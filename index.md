Hello, I’m Lamidi Morufat Kajogbola a graduate of Estate Management from Obafemi Awolowo University and a I have a frontend engineering certification from [devCareers](https://devcareer.io/).

I bring to the table a high level of focus, dedication, and commitment. My ambition is to consistently add value to any organization I represent through professional performance, transparency, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills and I hope to connect with other developers and learning from their experiences

Currently, I am in an Internship Trainee at Jamor Technology, and I am also enhancing my skills with #100DaysOfCode..

During my bootcamp, I served as the Assistant Lead for a capstone project at DevCareer. In this role, I facilitated communication and collaboration within the team, managed the project timeline, and presented our project to our mentor and person of contact. I also led the frontend team and contributed to the codebase. Our determination helped us in meeting the deadline and delivering a high-quality project that received positive feedback, placing us in the top 15 out of 52 teams.

I specialize in creating visually appealing web experiences with functionalities. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT and I'm currently learning a javascript library (React) as part of my learning journey

I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I'm ready to contribute my skills and passion to make a positive impact. Let's connect and explore together! Mind you I'm always up for a challenge
